I was born in Mexico city, one of the largest cities in the world at the time. It was also a dangerous city. We had the privilege to grow up in a house with a garden. This encouraged the development of a true love for nature and observation from our own garden, and also taking us to hikes at Ajusco National Park. 

I went to a french high school, were I learned to express myself fluently in the french language, but also, were I truly developed critical thinking and learned mathematical tools that I used during my PhD. I am a proud National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), Faculty of Sciences alumn. After college, I went on to pursue graduate studies at UNAM's Postgraduate Program in Biological Sciences. Advised by [Susana Magallón](http://www.ib.unam.mx/directorio/101) at the Biology Institute, UNAM, I studied methods to understand the species diversification process, and learned to develop and test models of speciation and extinction with [Hélène Morlon](http://www.phyloeco.biologie.ens.fr/) at the Center for Applied Mathematics of the Polytechnique School in Paris, France. I received my Ph.D. in 2016. I then continued to a postdoc position with [Brian O'Meara](http://brianomeara.info/) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, were I learned programming skills that would make me truly independent as a researcher. I am now a postdoc with [Emily Jane McTavish](https://www.rstudio.com/) at the newest campus of the University of California, in Merced, CA.

My [research](https://profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0001-7668-2528) focuses on method testing and development, with a particular interest in models of species diversification. For the past 3 years, I have invested my time on  development software for open science platforms, funded by the National Science Foundation. 
<!-- I have presented my work in Paris and in several conferences.
-->
<!--focus on health-related applications of Natural Language Processing-based methods, and was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, and Autism Speaks. I have written numerous scientific [publications](/publication) on autism and neurodevelopmental disorders and have presented my research at over 25 international conferences.-->

<!--While at OHSU, I became an avid user of the statistical programming language R, both in the lab as a Principal Investigator and in the classroom as a professor. I developed a passion for programming and education, and during my tenure at OHSU I developed and taught multiple graduate-level [data science courses](/categories/course/) and [workshops](/categories/workshop/). I also trained the [Office of Research Impact at the Oregon Clinical & Translational Research Institute](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/octri/) to use R, and consulted with the University of Oregon College of Education on the development of a [graduate data science specialization track](https://education.uoregon.edu/). I received an [Excellence in Education award](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/honors-and-awards-ceremony-2018-school-medicine) from OHSU in 2018.-->

You can follow my current work in software development to make available scientific information on time of origin of species on [GitHub](https://github.com/LunaSare). In my free time, I enjoy dancing, putting color on things, drawing designs, and spending time with family and friends -- virtually!
