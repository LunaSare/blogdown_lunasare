I am a biologist specialized in evolutionary biology. I am currently working as a postdoc at the McTavish Lab, at the School of Natural Sciences of the University of California, Merced. My research interests include species diversification processes, timing of species origin, the intercept between micro and macroevolution, open science, and science communication and reproducibility. For the past few years, I have been working on method and software development for various projects, including platforms such as [Datelife](http://datelife.org/query/), [Phylotastic](https://phylo.cs.nmsu.edu/), and most recently [Open Tree of Life](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/opentree/argus/opentree11.4@ott93302).
