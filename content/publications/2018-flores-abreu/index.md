title: Tempo and mode in coevolution of Agave sensu lato (Agavoideae, Asparagaceae) and its bat pollinators, Glossophaginae (Phyllostomidae)

summary: Agave sensu lato appeared around 8 Mya. The best supported diversification model for Agavoidae shows two shifts around 8 Mya. Agave sensu lato speciation rate has been increasing towards the present. Nectarivorous bats from the Glossophaginae subfamily originated around 7 Mya. Agave and their pollinating bats share a diffuse coevolutionary history.

abstract: The genus Agave sensu lato contains ca. 211 described species, many of which are considered keystone species because of their ecological dominance and the quantity of resources they provide with their massive, nectar-rich inflorescences. The large diversity of Agave species has been hypothesized as being related to their reproductive strategy (predominantly monocarpic) and diverse pollinators (e.g., bats, hummingbirds, hawkmoths). In particular, Agave species provide resources that a few genera of nectar feeding bats from the subfamily Glosophaginae are dependent upon. To explore a possible coevolutionary relationship between Agave and the bat species that pollinate them, we calibrated molecular phylogenies of both groups and looked for a correlation in their dates of divergence. One coding and two non-coding regions of the chloroplast genome were sequenced from 49 species of the Agavoideae (Asparagaceae), and the mitochondrial gene Cyt-b and nuclear coding gene RAG2 were either sequenced or obtained from gene bank for 120 Phyllostomid bats. Results from the analyses indicate that Agave sensu lato is a young genus (estimated crown age 2.7–8.5/stem age 4.6–12.3 Ma), with an increasing diversification rate, and the highest speciation rate among Agavoideae’s clades. The origin of the Glossophaginae bats (stem age 20.3–23.5 Ma) occurred prior to the stem age of Agave sensu lato, while the origin of the current pollinators of Agave species, members of the genera Glossophaga, Leptonycteris, Anoura, Choeronyscus, Musonycteris and Choeronycteris, was estimated to be around 6.3–16.2 Ma, overlapping with the stem age of Agave sensu lato, supporting the hypothesis of diffuse coevolution.
