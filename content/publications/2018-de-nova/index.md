title: Recent radiation and dispersal of an ancient lineage, the case of Fouquieria (Fouquiericeae, Ericales) in North American deserts

summary: Fouqueriaceae, the family of ocotillo and bojum tree, is a monogeneric clade with 11 species. Its siter group, the plox family, Polemoniaceae, has a diversity of 400 species. In this paper, we investigate the processes that have determined the species diversity of Fouquieriaceae.

abstract: Arid biomes are particularly prominent in the Neotropics providing some of its most emblematic landscapes and a substantial part of its species diversity. To understand some of the evolutionary processes underlying the speciation of lineages in the Mexican Deserts, the diversification of Fouquieria is investigated, which includes eleven species, all endemic to the warm deserts and dry subtropical regions of North America. Using a phylogeny from plastid DNA sequences with samples of individuals from populations of all the species recognized in Fouquieria, we estimate divergence times, test for temporal diversification heterogeneity, test for geographical structure, and conduct ancestral area reconstruction. Fouquieria is an ancient lineage that diverged from Polemoniaceae ca. 75.54 Ma. A Mio-Pliocene diversification of Fouquieria with vicariance, associated with Neogene orogenesis underlying the early development of regional deserts is strongly supported. Test for temporal diversification heterogeneity indicates that during its evolutionary history, Fouquieria had a drastic diversification rate shift at ca.12.72 Ma, agreeing with hypotheses that some of the lineages in North American deserts diversified as early as the late Miocene to Pliocene, and not during the Pleistocene. Long-term diversification dynamics analyses suggest that extinction also played a significant role in Fouquieriaâ€™s evolution, with a very high rate at the onset of the process. From the late Miocene onwards, Fouquieria underwent substantial diversification change, involving high speciation decreasing to the present and negligible extinction, which is congruent with its scant fossil record during this period. Geographic phylogenetic structure and the pattern of most sister species inhabiting different desert nucleus support that isolation by distance could be the main driver of speciation.
