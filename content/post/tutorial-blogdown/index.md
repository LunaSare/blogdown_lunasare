This tutorial is fully inspired by [Dan Quintana's](https://www.dsquintana.com/) twitter [post](https://twitter.com/dsquintana/status/1139846569623281664), and uses some of his material, all with permission from the author. Many thanks, Dan!!

I developed this presentation/tutorial as part of a lecture on science reproducibility and for a seminar on how to leverage your R knowledge to increase your academic presence online.
The presentation was generated with R, using [Yihue Xie's](https://yihui.org/en/about/) [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package.

There are many fun things about making a presentation with the `xaringan` package, but one of my favorites is that you can add links and widgets as if it were a webpage. So, when your are going through the tutorial, try clicking things around. You might discover something useful further down the tutorial!
