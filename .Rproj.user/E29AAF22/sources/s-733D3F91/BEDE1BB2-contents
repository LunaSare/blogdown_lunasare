title: Phylotastic, improving access to tree-of-life knowledge with flexible, on-the-fly delivery of trees

summary: Phylogenetic knowledge is of great importance for research and education. Yet, it remians mostly unavailable for the non-specialist and the general public. In this paper, we report a publicly accessible system for on-the-fly delivery of phylogenetic knowledge that consists of a web portal that implements 3 types of workflows to obtain species phylogenies (scaled by geologic time and decorated with thumbnail images); 19 underlying web services accessible via a common registry; and toolbox code in R and Python so that others can create applications that leverage these services.

abstract: A comprehensive phylogeny of species, i.e., a tree of life, has potential uses in a variety of contexts in research and education. This potential is limited if accessing the tree of life requires special knowledge, complex software, or long periods of training. The Phylotastic project aims to use web-services technologies to lower the barrier for accessing phylogenetic knowledge, making it as easy to get a phylogeny of species as it is to get online driving directions. In prior work, we designed an open system of web services to validate and manage species names, find phylogeny resources, extract subtrees matching a userâ€™s species list, calibrate them, and mash them up with images and information from online resources. Here we report a publicly accessible system for on-the-fly delivery of phylogenetic knowledge, developed with user feedback on what types of functionality are considered useful by researchers and educators. The system currently consists of a web portal that implements 3 types of workflows to obtain species phylogenies (scaled by geologic time and decorated with thumbnail images); 19 underlying web services accessible via a common registry; and toolbox code in R and Python so that others can create applications that leverage these services. These resources cover most of the use-cases identified in our analysis of user needs. The Phylotastic system, accessible via http://www.phylotastic.org, provides a unique resource to access the current state of phylogenetic knowledge, useful for a variety of cases in which a tree extracted quickly from online resources (as distinct from a tree custom-made from character data) is sufficient, as it is for many casual uses of trees identified here.
